## Comparisons with Other Rocket League Hacks

While Rocket League aimbot focuses on direct ball control and ESP boosts awareness, the **trainer is more versatile**. It doesn’t just give you an advantage in matches—it helps you train like a cheat-powered coach. Compared to external hacks, trainers are more about practice, creativity, and physics manipulation rather than pure domination.
